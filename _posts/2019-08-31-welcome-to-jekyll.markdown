I read many blog posts in my life and I always appreciate that there are so many smart and clever blogger out there who are willing to share their knowledge with everybody. I learned so much from that kind of people and I think it is just fair to give something back to the community.
In 2010 I wrote my last blog post publish at [bremora.wordpress.com](https://bremora.wordpress.com). It was fun and I realized that people are interested in some articles I wrote. In the meantime my focus changed a little bit but I still love to code. I will do my best to write articles and share all my knowledge, thoughts and ideas with you. Of course I'm looking forward to receive your feedback.

# What kind of articles will be published?
I still love the .NET stack. Especially with .NET Core we now have a real platform independent solution (to be honest: Mono was first but was not reliably for professional products). Although .NET is cool there are so many other amazing technologies out there and I experimented a lot in the past. But as a good software developer you need more. 
- You should follow cool patterns and architectures. 
- You should use cool tools which will make your life so much easier. 
- You should adopt the right process for your development team.

As you can see there are so many topics I try to cover. Stay tuned.

# Do you plan regular blog posts?
I will try my best to blog regularly but I cannot promise because there are other very important things in my life I have to consider (family, health, bills).

# Why did you start a new blog?
My new blog is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on my [GitHub Account](https://github.com/abremora). It is very easy to write and publish a blog. My [old blog](https://bremora.wordpress.com) is still available, of course.
